	<p><div id="specialstyle">There are no formal rules in the Netherlands</div> to distinguish cities from other settlements. Smaller<br/> settlements are usually called dorp, comparable with villages in English speaking countries. The Dutch<br/> word for city is stad (plural: steden). The intermediate category of town does not exist in the Netherlands.<hr/>
	</p>
	<p><span style="color:red">Historically, there existed systems of city rights</span>, granted by the territorial lords, which defined the status of a place: a stad or dorp. Cities were self-governing and had several privileges. In 1851 the granting of city rights and all privileges and special status of cities were abolished. Since then,<br/> the only local administrative unit is the municipality. Regardless of this legal change, many people still use the old city rights as a criterion: certain small settlements proudly call themselves a stad because they historically had city rights, while other,<br/> newer towns may not get this recognition.<hr/>
